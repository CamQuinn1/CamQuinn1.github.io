Firstly, we're working with spreadsheets. Virtual shop. Mechanism to do calculations simply and quickly. We created a function where we could select a product through a drop down  arrow (Data validation!!!) Pre-empts products and auto fills product. Makes finding your product much quicker. More accurate as it finds the actual information from column A. 	Finds exact entry from list. Click Data got to data validation. Select the range of the list as your stock. Unit price comes up from Vlookup V meaning vertical lookup used to find price of the item. False is at the end of the code because the list is not alphabetical. Include code from the spreadsheet in blog. If iferror is not included it doesnâ€™t allow you to total up the final price. We then started including discounts. Have to equate your percentage to a remaining decimal to then multiply your total by that number to find the discounted total. You want the cell with the remaining decimal to work itself out by itself. We then did the number of items purchased to decide whether or not you got a discount. If quantity is >= as sale item number then discount is initiated. If column E = hats than price = Price / 2.
