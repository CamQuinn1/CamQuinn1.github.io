Drawing 2D shapes: Week One of New Term

Today's class was the first of those with repl.it. After initially setting up our accounts through our Google accounts. We listened and watched demonstrations on what we were doing today: drawing letters. We started by using the following lines of code to set up the thing we were drawing with:

import turtle

turtle.shape()

turtle.speed()

turtle.width()

We then used functions such as turtle.forward() and turtle.left()/turtle.right() to draw certain 2D shapes. Towards the end of the lesson we experimented with the turtle.write("") function which instead of drawing using lines used the text that you chose to write in.
