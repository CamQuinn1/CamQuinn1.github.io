**Setting Up Our Shop:Week One**

Today was our first IT lesson of the year. We were shown an example of how to set up the online shop on google sheets. Firstly, we made a list of our products that we were selling. We then made a list of the prices of our items. We then set up on our spreadsheet using a vlookup function so we would have a drop down voice to make selecting items quicker and easier.
