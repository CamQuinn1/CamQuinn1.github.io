**Price and Products:Week Two**

This week we set up a function that, in short, matched the product we had selected with its price in a separate cell. It did this by using an if function where if a certain product was in a certain cell the price would appear next to it. We then worked with quantity of items. Where when we put a quantity in a cell it multiplied with the price to create a final price for the amount of items that were purchased.
